I've first opened strings.

I saw keyfile.txt string and went to it's XREF

I saw usage of "keyfile.txt" and afterwards the usage of "Registered to: "

I tried creating "keyfile.txt" in the exe's working directory with the content "Registered to: aBraM" (FAILED)

Theres a CreateFileA call
CreateFileA(
filename="keyfile.txt",
creation_disposition=OPEN_EXISTING
)

In order to debug my file creation I'll start using WinDbgX (I don't have a lot of time IRL so I returned to IDA)

ReadFileEx call with nNumberOfBytesToRead=1F (31)
if the file was successfully read concat it's content to "Registered to: "

I was right from the start. funny bug. 
Because I'm using a virtual machine my file extensions were hidden and I've created the file "keyfile.txt"
without realising it was actually "keyfile.txt.txt"
